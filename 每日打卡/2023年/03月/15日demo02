# 第09章_子查询的课后练习



#1.查询和Zlotkey相同部门的员工姓名和工资

SELECT last_name,salary
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
			SELECT department_id
			FROM employees
			WHERE last_name = 'Zlotkey'
			);

#2.查询工资比公司平均工资高的员工的员工号，姓名和工资。

SELECT employee_id,last_name,salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
		SELECT AVG(salary)
		FROM employees
		);

#3.选择工资大于所有JOB_ID = 'SA_MAN'的员工的工资的员工的last_name, job_id, salary

SELECT last_name,job_id,salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL(
		SELECT salary
		FROM employees
		WHERE job_id = 'SA_MAN'
		);


#4.查询和姓名中包含字母u的员工在相同部门的员工的员工号和姓名

SELECT employee_id,last_name
FROM employees 
WHERE department_id IN (
			SELECT DISTINCT department_id
			FROM employees
			WHERE last_name LIKE '%u%'
			);


#5.查询在部门的location_id为1700的部门工作的员工的员工号

SELECT employee_id
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
			SELECT department_id
			FROM departments
			WHERE location_id = 1700
			);


#6.查询管理者是King的员工姓名和工资

SELECT last_name,salary,manager_id
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IN (
			SELECT employee_id
			FROM employees
			WHERE last_name = 'King'
			);



#7.查询工资最低的员工信息: last_name, salary

SELECT last_name,salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary = (
		SELECT MIN(salary)
		FROM employees
		);


#8.查询平均工资最低的部门信息
#方式1：
SELECT *
FROM departments
WHERE department_id = (
			SELECT department_id
			FROM employees
			GROUP BY department_id
			HAVING AVG(salary ) = (
						SELECT MIN(avg_sal)
						FROM (
							SELECT AVG(salary) avg_sal
							FROM employees
							GROUP BY department_id
							) t_dept_avg_sal

						)
			);
#方式2：

SELECT *
FROM departments
WHERE department_id = (
			SELECT department_id
			FROM employees
			GROUP BY department_id
			HAVING AVG(salary ) <= ALL(
						SELECT AVG(salary)
						FROM employees
						GROUP BY department_id
						)
			);

#方式3： LIMIT

SELECT *
FROM departments
WHERE department_id = (
			SELECT department_id
			FROM employees
			GROUP BY department_id
			HAVING AVG(salary ) =(
						SELECT AVG(salary) avg_sal
						FROM employees
						GROUP BY department_id
						ORDER BY avg_sal ASC
						LIMIT 1		
						)
			);

#方式4：

SELECT d.*
FROM departments d,(
		SELECT department_id,AVG(salary) avg_sal
		FROM employees
		GROUP BY department_id
		ORDER BY avg_sal ASC
		LIMIT 0,1
		) t_dept_avg_sal
WHERE d.`department_id` = t_dept_avg_sal.department_id
		
#9.查询平均工资最低的部门信息和该部门的平均工资（相关子查询）
#方式1：
SELECT d.*,(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.`department_id`) avg_sal
FROM departments d
WHERE department_id = (
			SELECT department_id
			FROM employees
			GROUP BY department_id
			HAVING AVG(salary ) = (
						SELECT MIN(avg_sal)
						FROM (
							SELECT AVG(salary) avg_sal
							FROM employees
							GROUP BY department_id
							) t_dept_avg_sal

						)
			);
