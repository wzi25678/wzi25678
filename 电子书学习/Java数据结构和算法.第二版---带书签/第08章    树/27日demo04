Generation gap between parents and children

　　Nowadays, there are more and more(an increasing number of) misunderstandings between parents and children which is so-called generation gap. It is estimated that (75 percentages of parents often complain about their children's unreasonable behavior while children usually think their parents too old fashioned).

　　Why have there been so much misunderstanding between parents and children? Maybe the reasons can be listed as follows . The first one is that ( the two generations,having grown up at different times, have different likes and dislikes ,and common to talk abothus the disagreement often rises between them) . Besides(due to having little in common to talk about , they are not willing to sit face to face ) . The third reason is (with the pace of modern life becoming faster and faster , both of them are so busy with their work or study that they don't spare enough time to exchange ideas ).To sum up ,the main cause of XX is due to ( lack of communication and understanding each other) .

　　It is high time that something were done upon it. For one thing (children should respect their parents ).On the other hand ,( parents also should show solicitude for their children). All these measures will certainly bridge the generation gap .

　　The factors for (parents' worry is that children are indulge in television and spend too much time on it .) .First of all ,(with so many programs to choose from , children are not getting as much exercise as they should ).Then , there comes a case that ( some studies have show that excessive watching of television by millions of children has lowered their ability to achieve in school ).

pollution

　　Most of us today (recognize that environmental pollution has been a greatly serious problem. lots of plants trees corps are destroyed by bad air .many fish die of poisonous water. thousands of people die from eating poisoned fish or breathing in gas. therefore, environmental pollution should be responsible for these diseases that are disabling or bringing death not only to human beings but also to wildlife.) From above, we can find that the reasons why (environment are polluted more and more seriously) are as follows.

　　the primary reason, I think, is (the reason of harmful substances into the environment. for example, to prevent insects, farmers make use of great amounts of insecticides, so as to have bumper harvests. however, they pollute the air, water, and land ). Second,(the gas coming from the car engines and factories also make environment polluted badly ).the third reason actually is (the result of a growing population in the world . every day, so much litter and waste are poured out from houses, also pollute the environment ).the significance for (controlling pollution ) noted that it's high time that more effective measures should be taken .therefore,(new laws should be passed to limit the amount of pollutants from factories. moreover, in the households, there is an obvious need to reduce litter and waste. let's make our good efforts, and the world will be a safer place to live for us ).

pollution of environment

　　These days we often hear that (our living conditions are getting more and more serious because of the destruction of our environment ).It is common that (many trees and animals are near extinction, and the all-important food chain has been destroyed .).

　　Why does such circumstance occur in spite of social protects? For one thing ,(the population of the world is increasing so rapidly that the world has been so crowded. ).For another,(the overuse of natural resources has influenced the balance of natural ecology ). What is more , since ( the industrial revolution ) ,it is natural that (a great number of factories have been springing up like mushrooms .The smoke and harmful chemicals released from factories also pollute the environment ).

　　To solve the problem is not easy at all ,but is worthying .We should do something such as (planting more trees , equipping cars with pollution-control devices and learning to recycling natural resources )to improve the present situation ,and i do believe everything will be better in the future.





2019年6月大学英语六级作文万能模板：开头句型
　　1、Many people insist that... 很多人(坚持)认为……

　　这句话乍看没亮点，但将众人皆知的"think"换为"insist"有没有觉得高大上了许多?

　　2、With the development of(with the continuous progress of ) science and technology, more and more(an increasing number of) people believe that... 随着科技的发展,越来越多的人认为……

　　这个可是小编当年的“杀手锏”啊，虽谈不上洋气，但正确率百分百啊，还超好记!

　　3、A lot of people seem to think that... 很多人似乎认为……

　　"think"终于闪亮登场，但"seem to"为整个句子增添了点婉转之感，这种客观的方式貌似较受老外(尤其腐国人)喜爱。





2019年6月大学英语六级作文万能模板：引出不同观点
　　1、People's views on... vary from person to person. Some hold that... . However, others believe that.... 人们对……的观点因人而异。有些人认为.....然而其他人却认为……

　　看这个长度就已然鹤立鸡群。其实，也是一个蛮简单也好记的模板。

　　2、Attitudes toward (drugs) vary from person to person. 人们对待吸毒的态度因人而异。

　　乍一看，跟上句的开头神似，其实就是省略掉了"people's"，不仅清爽而且好像高端了一些。

　　3、People may have different opinions on... 人们对……可能会有不同的见解。

　　又是一个婉转的句子，展示其客观性。

　　4、There are different opinions among people as to... 关于……人们的观点大不相同。

　　"different"虽拉低了水准，但"as to"又拯救了回来。

　　5、Different people hold different attitudes toward (failure). 对(失败)人们的态度各不相同。





2019年6月大学英语六级作文万能模板：得出最终结论
　　1、Taking all these factors into consideration, we naturally come to the conclusion that... 把所有这些因素加以考虑，我们自然会得出结论……

　　很完全的答法，"take sth into consideration"短语的应用，加分。

　　2、Taking into account all these factors, we may reasonably come to the conclusion that... 考虑所有这些因素，我们可能会得出合理的结论……

　　"Take into account sth"短语似乎又比上句的"take sth into consideration"提升了一个层次。

　　3、Hence/Therefore, we'd better come to the conclusion that... 因此，自然我们得出以下结论。。。

　　"Hence"一词用在文章中大气吧，但别平时口语中用，否则即使老外也用一种看老古董的眼神看你。。。

　　再特意提一句："we'd better"在这里不是“不得不”或“最好”的意思，而是一种自然而然，水到渠成的得出结论。

　　4、There is no doubt that (job-hopping) has its drawbacks as well as merits. 毫无疑问，跳槽有优点也有缺点。

　　短语"there is no doubt that"上线，同时运用我们的老朋友"as well as"增加看点。

　　5、All in all, we cannot live without... But at the same time we must try to find out new ways to cope with the problems that would arise. 总之，我们没有……是无法生活的。但同时，我们必须寻求新的解决办法来对付可能出现的新问题。



2019年6月大学英语六级作文万能模板：提出建议
　　1、It is high time that we put an end to the (trend). 该是我们停止这一趋势的时候了。

　　"It is high time" 打头，为该句增色。注：that 后跟虚拟语气，后跟动词的一般过去式，表示“是某人做……的时候了”或者“是某人不做……的时候了”

　　2、It is time to take the advice of ... and to put special emphasis on the improvement of ... 该是采纳……的建议，并对……的进展给予非常重视的时候了。

　　去掉一个"high"，画风完全不一样，不用过去式，只需用"to do"来替代。

　　3、There is no doubt that enough concern must be paid to the problem of ... 毫无疑问，对……问题应予以足够的重视。

　　"there is no doubt that"+被动还是蛮经典的组合。

　　4、Obviously,.... If we want to do something... , it is essential that... 显然，如果我们想做某事，我们需要……

　　这句有些老生常谈，稍微不“常”的就是"essential" 替代了"important"。

　　5、Only in this way can we... 只有这样,我们才能...

　　Only+倒装，经典万能句式，还能看出点水平呢。

　　6、It must be realized that... 我们必须意识到...

　　把人人都会的"I realized"升格为被动语态，省略了主语，监考老师绝对会眼前一亮的!





2019年6月大学英语六级作文万能模板：预示后果
　　1、Obviously, if we don't control the problem, the chances are that... will lead us in danger. 很明显，如果我们不能控制这一问题,很有可能我们会陷入危险。

　　"the chances are that"替代了"may"，果然说话拐弯的生物不止是中国人。

　　2、No doubt, unless we take effective measures, it is very likely that... 毫无疑问，除非我们采取有效措施，否则很可能会……

　　作文结尾万用句，毫无破绽。

　　3、It is urgent that immediate measures should be taken to stop the situation. 应立即采取措施阻止这一事态的发展。

　　"It is urgent that"+被动，效果不错滴。





2019年6月大学英语六级作文万能模板：解决问题

　　In recent days, we have to face I problem-----A, which is becoming more and more serious. First, ------------(说明A的现状).Second, ---------------(举例进一步说明现状)
