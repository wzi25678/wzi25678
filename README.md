Follow me on E-mail (2567839929@qq.com)! I'm pushing forward multiple open source projects I believe many developers would be interested in. These projects will involve game and network development with a focus on modding support. See my projects below for more details ðŸ™‚

### Why Did You Follow Me?

I **manually** follow users because I'm looking for projects to support and contribute to. I love reading code from others and contributing to the open source community!

### Me, Myself & I

```
printf("Hi!");
```

I am a self-taught engineer with a love for modding, creating things, and generally having fun & making things that improves other people's lives. I own the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) and also work on open source projects such as [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and [@Gamecom](https://github.com/gamemann/gamecom)!

[Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) acts as my portfolio and lists a lot of information regarding my skills, experience, and how to contact me. The website's source code and deployments may be found [here](https://github.com/Deaconn-net)! I hope some of you find the code interesting!
